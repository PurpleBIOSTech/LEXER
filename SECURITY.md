# Security Policy

Here is everything about the security in our LEXER program. Please note that using batch can mean taking control over Windows. There are some
Windows commands that are kinda dangreous such as 'del system32' but don't worry cause it needs administrative privleges.
There will be fakes that will try to convince you that they are us. The code that we have in our program doesn't need administrative privleges.
If at the beginning or any part of the app asks you to run LEXER as an administrator, don't. It may contain malicious code that will be executed and will
destroy your machine.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

First of, disconnect from internet and close the app. Second, send us the infected file
so that we can update the scanner if it's a new threat. We recommend you to send us the
scanner to see if the file was infected as well.
Automatically the scanner will run when LEXER is executed. The hacker will, logically, remove
that function and will probably delete the scanner from your PC. We uploaded our scanner to be downloaded
online in case someone lost it.
Since batch can be used to control over Windows, they will likely to delete and modify your files. 
Be aware that they will try to download a virus from malicious sites.

STAY SAFE!
