# Security Policy

Here is everything about the security in our LEXER program. Please note that using batch can mean taking control over Windows. There are some
Windows commands that are dangreous such as 'del system32' but don't worry cause it needs administrative privleges that you will need some commands to access it.
There will be fakes that will try to convince you that they are us. The code that we have in our program doesn't need administrative privleges.
If at the beginning or any part of the app asks you to run LEXER as an administrator, don't. It may contain malicious code that will be executed and will
destroy your machine.

We have made a scanner for all harmful scripts. If you download LEXER from a site and don't find scanner.bat, we recommend you to not execute the LEXER file. Below, you will see suported scanner for LEXER.

## Supported Versions


| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
|  1.0 >  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

First of, disconnect from internet and close the app. Second, send us the infected file
so that we can update the scanner if it's a new threat. We recommend you to send us the
scanner to see if the file was infected as well.
Automatically the scanner will run when LEXER is executed. The hacker will, logically, remove
that function and will probably delete the scanner from your PC. We uploaded our scanner to be downloaded
online in case someone lost it.
Since batch can be used to control over Windows, they will likely to delete and modify your files. 
Be aware that they will try to download a virus from malicious sites.

## How to prevent yourself from getting infected

The first rule is, always run scanner.bat before any harmful scripts. The scanner will automatically delete LEXER and will create a new one like nothing has been modified (if it has been infected).
Second rule is, if scanner wasn't runned on startup, please see if it's an international bug (e.x did anyone experience this?). If it's international, then it might be a bug. Updating LEXER might help but if you have the latest version then wait until a new update is released.

If you think that both of the files were infected (including the update file), then send it to the contributors.

STAY SAFE!
