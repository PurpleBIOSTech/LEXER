# LEXER Terms Of Policy

## PRIVACY
LEXER will NEVER collect your data nor spy on you unless if it's an Emergency. Data that LEXER will collect under those conditions is just the code of LEXER files.

## SERVICE
LEXER is a free OS with lifetime free updates. You can use LEXER how ever you want, but modifying it's code will result into full system destruction (nah just kidding with ya, instead, it will only delete itself from the system and will ban you from our sites).

# If you accept LEXER's Terms Of Policy, you are agreeing to the policy below:
## If LEXER caused any damage to the system, people who made it take no responsibility!
